# Energy Demand Forecasting Using ARIMA (End-to-End Project)

An end-to-end implementation of **energy demand forecasting** using the **ARIMA** model. This project walks through data ingestion, exploratory analysis, modeling, evaluation, and deployment-ready forecasting.

---

##  Project Overview
This project forecasts energy demand using a time series forecasting pipeline implemented in Python. Leveraging statistical models—specifically **ARIMA**—it delivers forecasts that can guide energy management and planning decisions.

---

##  Features
- Data loading & preprocessing  
- Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, noise)  
- Stationarity testing (ADF, KPSS tests)  
- ARIMA parameter selection (e.g., grid search, AIC/BIC)  
- Model fitting & residual diagnostics  
- Forecast generation & visualization  
- Performance evaluation (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)  
- (Optional) Deployment-ready API using Flask or similar
